# Pneumonia-Detection
This project focuses on building a Pneumonia Detection System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The model analyzes chest X-ray images to automatically classify whether a patient has Pneumonia or is Normal.  The goal of this project is to assist in early diagnosis by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. This project uses a deep learning-based image classification model trained on chest X-ray datasets to detect pneumonia with high accuracy.

The system:
- Preprocesses X-ray images
- Trains a CNN-based model
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Predicts pneumonia from new/unseen X-ray images
