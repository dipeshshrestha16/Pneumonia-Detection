# Pneumonia-Detection
This project focuses on building a Pneumonia Detection System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. The model analyzes chest X-ray images to automatically classify whether a patient has Pneumonia or is Normal.  The goal of this project is to assist in early diagnosis by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
